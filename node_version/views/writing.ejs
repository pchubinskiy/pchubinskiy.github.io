    Synopsis:
    <br>
    I wrote an aesthetic component for existential theory that understood consumption of art as a respite for bad faith, and production of art as a respite for nausea.
    In this essay, art is taken to mean a cultural object such as a performance, painting, or novel.
    More generally, my intent was to:
    provide a understanding of art that could be used in identifying Western and non-Western forms of art;
    account for how genres are created and recognized;
    write a theory that integrated notions of repression (bad faith as lying-to-yourself) so that it would be compatible with writing in sociology, economics, political science, etc, that draws on notions of ideology;
    understand art as serving a practical purpose--respite--so that the theory is conducive to quantitative analysis.
