    <p>I majored in Literature and Visual Arts at Duke University, where I did graduate-level research and completed challenging art and design projects. After graduating from college, I tutored reading and writing for college entrance exams, began applying for technical writing and copy editing work, and took a web development internship with a local startup.</p>
    <p>I got interested in web development because it rewarded patience and attention to detail and because I was excited about the potential of open source, data visualization, and using code to build educational tools. Working on real projects convinced me that I wanted to pursue a career involving web development and that I could also use my writing and visual arts skills in this line of work. Inspired by this, I recently completed the Web Development Immersive program at General Assembly in Austin, TX, where I learned full-stack development.</p>
    <p>My hobbies include watching basketball and soccer, reading and writing, and exercising. I also like to change what I put here.</p>
